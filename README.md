   - For each ticket:
      - Review the ticket details
      - Confirm the severity level and priority
      - Assign the ticket to the appropriate team or individual(especially as an agent with limited capabilities, such as only being able to assign and reply to tickets)

4. Ticket Lifecycle Management
Update the ticket status as it progresses through the lifecycle:

   - Open: Ticket is created and awaiting action.
   - In Progress: Team is actively working on a solution.
   - Resolved: The issue has been addressed and resolved.
   - Closed: Confirm closure of the ticket.

5. Communication and Collaboration
   - Utilize the comment section in each ticket to communicate updates, solutions, or additional information.
   - Collaborate with team members through comments to share insights or request assistance.

6. Monitor and Review
   - Regularly review the ticket dashboard to monitor the status of all tickets.
   - Conduct periodic reviews to analyze the resolution time and identify areas for improvement.

7. Practice and Iterate
   - Repeat the process with additional tickets to practice and refine your ticket management skills.
   - Make adjustments to the workflow or priorities based on the lessons learned during the practice.
